git merge - used to combine one branch into currently active. For example we have two branches that firstly were completetly different, but now it should be in one branch with all history that we commited, so we are using 'git merge';


git rebase - moves all files and history from one branch to another with rewriting. For example we have two branches and one of them is became completely useless for us, so we are using 'git rebase' to move currently active branch to another one.

So, very simple exaple, when you need both branches under one more suitable name, we are using 'git merge', and if we dont need one of the branch at all but it have useful name, we are using 'git rebase'. Also we can rename branches.
